    HW:

o    Main thing: homework.

§  The 99 bottles problem has 3 main methods:

·         Verse

·         Verses

·         Song

§  My Naive next step… is there a verse next step? Versable??

o    Data comes in as

§  A

§  B

§  C

o    We need to do two unrelated tasks. Each requires some portion of A/B/C (or an aggregate of them)

o    Can the “do something” part of the code have an interface that segregates it from the data model??

o    Can my model wear many hats?

o    Example hats:

§  Serialization & deserialization (can your model spit itself out as… JSON/Yaml/pick your format).

·         That could be used by a function that writes it to a file.

§  Loggable… implements some kind of prettyPrint method that gets called. Isn’t just [object Object]

o    What about…

§  Start a fastify project

§  Implement a bike model. It has properties like:

·         Frame material

·         Number of speeds

·         Handlebar type

·         Etc.

§  Implement a /bike route

·         That returns the bike as Markdown

·         That logs the bike being rendered in a nice way

§  Implement a log() method with unit tests that uses an interface

§  Implement a markdown() method that generates a markdown doc using an interface

§  Implement a totally different model that conforms to the same interfaces and make it available too
