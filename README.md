### Code Expense Questions to Consider

1. How difficult was it to write?
2. How hard is it to understand?
3. How expensive will it be to change?

### Does the code expose the domain of the problem?

1. How many verse variants are there?
2. Which verses are most alike? In what way?
3. Which verses are most different, and in what way?
4. What is the rule to determine which verse comes next?

### Judging Code

## ABC:

1. Assignments is a count of variable assignments.
2. Branches counts not branches of an if statement (as one could forgivably infer) but
   branches of control, meaning function calls or message sends.
3. Conditions counts conditional logic.
